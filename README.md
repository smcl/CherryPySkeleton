# CherryPySkeleton

Webapp skeleton for anyone who doesn't want to get a quick and simple UI running with the following already hooked up and ready to go:

* CherryPy
* SQLite3
* Mako
* Bootstrap
* JQuery

There are two simple pages served currently:
* /index
* /about

and there is one service exposed via GET:
* /ajax

There's nothing fancy or revolutionary here, it's mostly just to allow me to quickly dive into putting together little webapps for personal use without fussing around with all the BS boilerplate.
