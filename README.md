# CherryPySkeleton

Webapp skeleton for anyone who wants to get a quick and simple UI running with the following already hooked up and ready to go:

* CherryPy
* Mako
* SQLite3
* Bootstrap
* JQuery

There are two simple pages served currently:
* /index
* /about

and there is one service:
* /datetime (returns json with current Czech date and time and UTC time)

There's nothing fancy or revolutionary here, it's mostly just to allow me to quickly dive into putting together little webapps for personal use without fussing around with all the BS boilerplate. Everything is extremely simple, since theres only two simple pages even for beginners to spot how to hook things up and what comes from where. Let me know if you need a hand, I'm not a web developer by trade but I know enough :)
